I’m a Ph.D. student at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en), working in the [Doiron Lab](https://brainmath.bsd.uchicago.edu/) on neural plasticity and hysteresis. Before that, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), graduating cum laude with honors.

My research background spans data-driven modeling of dynamical systems, numerical analysis, and computer vision. I’ve collaborated with faculty from institutions including [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and my alma mater, the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

Outside of academia, I enjoy strength training, hiking, and occasionally getting too serious about badminton. I’m fluent in English and Mandarin—feel free to reach out in either.
