I"¾<p>I am a Ph.D. student at The University of Chicago. While I am still in the process of defining the precise direction of my research, I am particularly intrigued by the potential of leveraging machine learning to address challenging mathematical problems that prove difficult through traditional methodologies. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, graduating Cum Laude with honors.</p>

<p>My past work has encompassed data-driven modeling of dynamical systems, numerical analysis, and computer vision. Iâ€™ve had the privilege and honor of collaborating with esteemed faculties from institutions such as <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, and <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>.</p>

<p>My passion for computers extends from hardware to software. In hardware, Iâ€™m intrigued by the evolution and advancements of computer technology. On the software front, Iâ€™m adept at using programming to resolve challenges I encounter in both my academic and personal life. My expertise lies in Python, though I also have professional experience with Java, C++, Matlab, and Julia. Additionally, I regularly employ tools like bash, shell, and Docker to enhance my workflow efficiency.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not diving deep into academics or tech stuff, youâ€™ll probably find me enjoying a good workout, taking a hike, or getting competitive with a game of badminton. Iâ€™m comfortable chatting in both English and Mandarin, so feel free to contact me in whichever language you prefer.</p>
